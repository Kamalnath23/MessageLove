                <p>I was selfish and ignorant of your feelings in the past days. I regret that and i apologise that i hurt you and your beloved one at the bottom of my heart.</p>
                <p>I admit that i made mistakes, and the truth is I can't revert back. And only thing i can do now is to focus on things i can control and waiting patiently for you.</p>
